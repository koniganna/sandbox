 know sometimes you're scared of the light

But how will you ever know if you never try

There's something new inside my heart

And it grabs like a child

Whenever we're apart

I see your face under every sky

I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start


And it grabs like a child

Whenever we're apart

I see your face under every sky

But how will you ever know if you never try
